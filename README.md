#  Exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with JSFiddle

In this lab, we will explore all the components of an HTML file, including HTML markup, CSS styling, and JavaScript code.

## Learning Objectives

- Get comfortable with JSFiddle.
- Fiddle with HTML.
- Fiddle with CSS.
- Fiddle with JavaScript.

## What is JSFiddle?

JSFiddle is a playground for novice and experienced web developers alike. It is an online web application that allows anyone to experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As you make changes, you can see the impact of those changes live.

Before effectively using JSFiddle, you need to know a few things. Refer to the screenshot below:

![JSFiddle Screenshot](jsfiddle_screenshot.png)

- The HTML area is where you type all the HTML tags and the web page text.
- The CSS area is where you type all the CSS styling information.
- The JavaScript area is where you type in the JavaScript code to make your web page interactive.
- The preview area is where your web page is displayed as it would appear in a web browser.

The most important button is the "Run" button. Whenever you make any changes in any area, you must click the "Run" button to refresh the preview area. The best thing about JSFiddle is that no matter what you do, you can't break anything here!

## Exercises

Your exercises are given below. Try them out.

1. [Exercise 1: Fiddle with HTML](https://jsfiddle.net/u7oxzgmj/13/)

   HTML provides the text content and the markup of a web page.

   - In the HTML area, line number 10 has the main heading of the page. Replace "Tom" with your name. Click on the "Run" button. You should see the new heading with your name in the preview area.

   - Line number 13 defines a paragraph using `<p>` tag. Line number 14 has the text displayed inside the paragraph. Replace the text with any text of your choice. Click on the "Run" button. You should see the new text reflected in the preview area.

   - Line number 16 defines a division using `<div>` tag. Line number 17 and 18 have the text displayed inside the div. Replace the text with any text of your choice. Click on the "Run" button. You should see the new text reflected in the preview area.

2. **Exercise 2: Fiddle with CSS**

   CSS provides styling information (such as colors, fonts, and sizes) to the browser.

   - In the CSS area, line number 2 controls the background color of the web page. Replace 'tan' with 'grey'. Click on the "Run" button. You should see the new color reflected in the preview area. Experiment with other valid colors like blue, red, green, light blue, and yellow.

   - Line number 6 controls the font used to display the text in the paragraph (`<p>`) element. Replace 'arial' with 'times'. Click on the "Run" button. You should see the new font reflected in the preview area.

   - Line number 13 controls how wide the `div` should be. Change the width to 400px. Click on the "Run" button. You should see a wider `div`.

3. **Exercise 3: Fiddle with JavaScript**

   JavaScript makes a web page interactive. When you click on the "Wish" button, the page displays an alert that says "Hello, how are you doing?"

   - In the JavaScript area, line number 2 defines the message that is displayed whenever the "Wish" button is clicked. Replace the message with "Good Day". Click on the "Run" button. Click on the "Wish" button in the preview area. You should see a pop-up alert with your new message. Try with "Hola, como estas" (which means "Hello, how are you doing" in Spanish).

   - Line number 5 has a function named showtime. It displays the current time. In the HTML area, line number 21 has the word 'Wish'. Replace it with 'Show Time'. Replace 'hello()' in line number 20 with 'showtime()'. Click on the "Run" button. In the preview area, you will now see a button named 'Show Time'. Click on it, and a message with the current time should pop up.

## Next Steps

Try fiddling with the code. You cannot break it. When you think you have really messed up, just [click here](https://jsfiddle.net/u7oxzgmj/13/) or right-click, copy the link, and paste it into a new browser window. It will open a new tab with the original HTML document so you can start fiddling from the beginning.
