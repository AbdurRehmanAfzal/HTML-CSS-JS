Learning Objectives
Get comfortable with JSFiddle.
Fiddle with HTML.
Fiddle with CSS.
Fiddle with JavaScript.
What is JSFiddle?
JSFiddle is a playground for novice and experienced web developers alike. It is an online web application which allows anyone to play around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As you make changes, you can see the impact of those changes live.

You need to know a few things before effectively making use of JSFiddle.

Refer to the screenshot below.

jsfiddle


The HTML area is the place where you type all the HTML tags and the web page text.

The CSS area is the place where you type in all the CSS styling information.

The JavaScript area is the place where you type in the JavaScript code to make your web page interactive.

The preview area is the place where your web page would be displayed as it would on a web browser.

The most important one for you is the “Run” button. Whenever you make any changes in any area, you must click the “Run” button to refresh the preview area.

And the best thing about JSFiddle is that no matter what you do, you can’t break anything here!

Your exercises are given below. Try them out.

Open a new browser tab. Copy the url given below in the address bar of the new tab, press Enter or return to open it and follow the rest of the instructions.

Exercise 1: Fiddle with HTML.
HTML provides the text content and the markup of a web page.

In the HTML area, line number 10 has the main heading of the page.

Replace Tom with your name.
Click on the “Run” button.
You should see the new heading with your name in the preview area.
Line number 13 defines a paragraph using <p> tag. Line number 14 has the text displayed inside the paragraph.

Replace the text with any text of your choice.
Click on the “Run” button.
You should see the new text reflected in the preview area.
Line number 16 defines a division using <div> tag. Line number 17 and 18 have the text displayed inside the div.

Replace the text with any text of your choice.
Click on the “Run” button.
You should see the new text reflected in the preview area.
Exercise 2: Fiddle with CSS.
CSS provides styling information (such as colors, fonts, and sizes) to the browser. The browser uses this information to customize the view.

In the CSS area, line number 2 controls the background color of the web page..

Replace ‘tan’ with ‘grey’.
Click on the “Run” button.
You should see the new color reflected in the preview area.
Blue, red, green, lightblue, and yellow are all valid colors. Fiddle with them.
Line number 6 controls the font used to display the text in the paragraph (<p>) element.

Replace ‘arial’ with ‘times’.
Click on the “Run” button.
You should see the new font reflected in the preview area.
Line number 13 controls how wide the div should be.

Change the width to 400px.
Click on the “Run” button.
You should see a wider div.
Exercise 3: Fiddle with JavaScript.
JavaScript makes a web page interactive. When you click on the “Wish” button, the page displays an alert that says “Hello how are you doing?”

Note: If the alert does not appear, then please allow pop up for this website by changing your browser settings

In the JavaScript area, line number 2 defines the message that is displayed whenever the “Wish” button is clicked.

Replace the message with “Good Day”.
Click on the “Run” button.
Click on the “Wish” button in the preview area.
You should see a pop-up alert with your new message.
Try with “Hola, como estas”. By the way, that is “Hello, how are you doing” in Spanish.
Line number 5 has a function named showtime. It displays the current time.

In the HTML area, line number 21 has the word ‘Wish’. Replace it with ‘Show Time’.
Replace ‘hello()’ in line number 20 with ‘showtime()’.
Click on the “Run” button.
In the preview area, you will now see a button named ‘Show Time’.
Click on it. A message with the current time should pop up.
Next Steps
Try fiddling with the code. You cannot break it. When you think you have really messed up, just click here or right click, copy the link, and paste it on a new browser window. It will open a new tab with the original HTML document so you can start fiddling from the beginning.
